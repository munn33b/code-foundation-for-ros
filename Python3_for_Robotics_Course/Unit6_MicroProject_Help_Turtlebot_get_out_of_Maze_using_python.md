##         6.1                 Scene    

This first part of the project will be based on a new environment, which is a maze like this one:

##         6.2                 Turtlebot    

For this project, you will use Turtlebot robot.

##         6.3                 Task to accomplish    

Create a Python program that, using ALL the methods from the **robot_control_class.py** Python script, helps the Turtlebot robot to get out of the maze.

Just to help you out, let's make a summary of all the methods you've been using throughout the course:

- get_laser (direction)

  : As the name itself says,  this method will allow you to get data from the laser of the robot. You  will need to pass one parameter to this method:

  - **direction**: Here you will specify a number between 0 and 719, which will indicate the direction of the laser reading.

- **get_laser_full()**: As the name itself says, this  method will allow you to get all the data from ALL the laser beams of  the robot. As I've said before, this is a total of 719 different  readings. So, when called, this method will return a **LIST** containing all the 719 different readings from the laser beams.

- **move_straight()**: As the name says, this method will allow you to start moving the robot in a straight line.

- **stop_robot()**: As the name says, this method will allow you to stop the robot from moving.

- move_straight_time(motion, speed, time)

  : As the  name itself says, this method will allow you to move the robot in a  straight line. You will need to pass three parameters to it.

  - **motion**: Specify here if you want your robot to move forward (**"forward"**) or backward (**"backward"**).
  - **speed**: Specify here the speed at which you want your robot to move (in m/s).
  - **time**: Specify here how long you want your robot to keep moving (in seconds).

- turn (clockwise, speed, time)

  : As the name itself says, this method will allow you to turn the robot. You will need to pass three parameters to it.

  - **clockwise**: Specify here whether you want your robot to turn clockwise (**"clockwise"**) or counter-clockwise (**"counter-clockwise"**).
  - **speed**: Specify here the speed at which you want your robot to turn (in rad/s).
  - **time**: Specify here how long you want your robot to keep turning (in seconds).

Finally, and for this project, you are going to be able to use a new method.

- rotate (degrees)

  : This method will allow your robot to rotate for the specified number of degrees.

  - **degrees**: The number of degreees you want your robot to rotate.

**NOTE**: In theory, you can also make the  robot rotate a certain number of degrees by using the **turn()** method  and playing with the *speed* and *time* values. However, this method is  going to be less precise than the **rotate()** method, because it's not  taking into account external sources like the odometry of the robot  (which the **rotate()** method does).

â€‹    \- robot_control_class.py -

Below you can find the updated code for the **robot_control_class.py** class, which contains the new **rotate()** method.
